<!--
This is the config file that defines the different CHIPS geometries

Parameters and descriptions:
===========
Main Detector (required)

innerRadius
  - Radius of the inner part of the detector in m
innerHeight
  - Height of the inner part of the detector in m
nSides
  - Number of sides of the regular polygon that makes up the cross-sectional
    area of the detector

PMT (required)

pmtName1
  - Name of the PMT (as named in pmtDefinitions.xml) to be used in the unit 
    cells
perCentCoverage
  - The required percentage of the inner detector area to be covered with 
    PMT photocathode.

PMT (optional)

pmtName2
  - Name of an optional second PMT to be used in the unit cells
pmtRatio
  - Ratio of number of PMT1 to PMT2 per unit cell such that PMT1 is always
    the most numerous PMT
